### Milestone:

The course is built around "microshots", which are 5-second videos generated in each session. Each microshot will focus on key aspects of the production process like modeling, rendering, lighting, texturing, particles, visual fx, IK, sound, dynamic simulation, etc. 

The course deliverable will be a 1-minute video reel production containing all the microshots, and uploaded to Vimeo.
