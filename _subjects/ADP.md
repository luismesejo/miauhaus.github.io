## a.11 Algorithms, Data and Processes
Number of Sessions/Duration 24 (60 hours)

### Seminarâ€™s description:
This course introduces the core concepts of computer programming within the context of the visual arts. 
Organized into themes linked to aspects of code -repetition, transformation, parameters, visualization and simulation- it will focus on algorithms and their affiliated programming techniques, with a particular focus on object-oriented programming. Algorithmic processes, harnessed through the medium of computer code, allow us to generate increasingly complex visual forms. We will learn the basics of programming (variables, conditionals, loops, objects, arrays) and a series of applications related to making interactive projects (images, pixels, computer vision, networking, data). Creating computer applications, instead of just using them, will give us a deeper understanding of the essential possibilities of computation and an in-depth analysis of the aesthetics of the information age.
