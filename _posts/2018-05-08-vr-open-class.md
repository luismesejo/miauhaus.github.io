REACTIVE ENVIRONMENTS & LANDSCAPES came to an end last [May](https://www.facebook.com/events/201802960608942/). We watched the projects that the students developed during the course and we experimented with them. Every project was shown with VR glasses.
This class is part of REACTIVE ENVIRONMENT & LANDSCAPES, given by Daniel Bas.

Here are two projects developed by two of our students: Sergio Limiñana and Francesc Sòria.
